I started working on a single php file at first, and from there went on to make the wordpress theme.
For this reason, the original file doesn't have everything that the theme has, but since I read on the assignment
that this file is required, I tried to make the original file again. The file is called base for theme.php

Although the theme is quite simplistic, everything should be working as intended!
